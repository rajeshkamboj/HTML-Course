Here is the list of main terminal commands which we'll be using over and over during this course:
1. To change directory
cd  --> move to home directory
cd ../ --> move a dir back
cd <DIR NAME>  ->> to change dir

2. Create a new directory
mkdir <DIR NAME>

3. cat filename.extension  --> read the content of file.

4. clear --> clear the terminal

5. pwd  ->> present working directory
